# Resilience Hubs


The [Resilience Hub concept](http://resilience-hub.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/USDN_ResilienceHubsGuidance-1.pdf) is being developed by a [Kristin Baja](https://buildingresilience2019.sched.com/speaker/kristin_baja.1zpoqdz6), a former Resilience Planner for the City of Baltimore, as well as by [UN Habitat](https://urbanresiliencehub.org/).  It consists of local community centers outfitted with energy, water, food, and communications infrastructure that might be useful in case of disaster (flood, etc.).  How might such resilience hubs begin to establish alternative, more convivial approaches to developing municipal infrastructure? How might they be prototyped in various communities today?
