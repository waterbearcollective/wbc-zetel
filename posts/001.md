# Peer Moderation 

What if every participant in the exchange -- including audience members -- had the ability to determine and share their own moderation settings?  Other peers in the network could then 'subscribe' or 'unsubscribe' to those moderation settings, as per their preference. Versions of such a 'trust network' are being explored -- cf. Alexander Cobleigh's [Masters Thesis](https://cblgh.org/dl/trustnet-cblgh.pdf) and [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVkesgWZlTU).
